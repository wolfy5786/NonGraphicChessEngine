## Overview

This is a simple, non-graphical, two-player chess game implemented in Java. It runs entirely in the terminal, allowing two human players to play chess using algebraic move notation (e.g., `e2e4`). The game enforces standard chess rules including legal moves, check/checkmate detection, castling, promotion, and en passant.
